1. Repository Adapters: Create adapter services for each repository platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) that you want to support. Each adapter will be responsible for interacting with the respective platform's API to fetch release information and track changes.

2.  Release Fetcher Service: Develop a Release Fetcher microservice in Go to manage the repository adapters. This service will communicate with the appropriate adapter based on the repository platform and fetch the necessary release data. To keep track of changes, the Release Fetcher service can periodically poll the repository adapters for updates.

3.  Database: Store the fetched release data in a database such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB. This database will help maintain a record of releases and changes for future reference and analysis. You can use an ORM like GORM to interact with the database in Go.

4.  Change Notification Service: Implement a Change Notification microservice in Go to process and send notifications for any tracked changes in the repositories. This service can consume messages from the message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka) populated by the Release Fetcher service whenever there's an update in the tracked repositories.

5.  Webhook Support: Add webhook support to your repository adapters, so they can receive real-time updates from the repository platforms instead of relying solely on polling. This will make the change tracking more efficient and reduce latency.

6.  Error Handling & Retries: Implement proper error handling and retries in your services to handle failures, rate limits, and other possible issues when interacting with external APIs.

7.  Caching: Add caching layers where appropriate (e.g., using Redis) to minimize the load on external APIs and improve performance.

8.  Authentication & Authorization: Secure your services with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth2, JWT, or API tokens, to ensure only authorized users can access and manage the tracked repositories.

9.  Monitoring & Logging: Set up monitoring and logging for your services using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack to track performance, detect issues, and troubleshoot problems.

###  Layout
cmd/: This directory contains the entry points for each microservice. Each microservice has its own subdirectory and a main.go file.

internal/: This directory holds the internal packages for the application. These packages are not intended to be used by external projects.

adapters/: Contains the repository adapters for various platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
database/: Contains the code related to database connections, schema management, and data access.
models/: Contains the data models and types used throughout the application.
notifications/: Holds the code for sending notifications via different channels (e.g., email, Slack).
utils/: Contains utility functions and common code used across the application, such as authentication, logging, and error handling.
pkg/: This directory holds the public packages, which can be used by external projects if needed. It contains the API definitions and shared configuration code.

api/: Contains the API definitions for each microservice.
config/: Holds the code for managing configuration, such as parsing configuration files, handling environment variables, and setting defaults.
.gitignore: Lists the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

docker-compose.yml: Contains the Docker Compose configuration for running the application using containers.
